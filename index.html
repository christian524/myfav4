        <h1>Drawing and Sci-Fi</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>  Peace!My name is Christian. I am a 6th grade student well almost 7th grade, I am 11 years old. I love drawing, because I have a feeling that anyone could understand a drawing, and a drawing makes things more realistic and interesting.Though I am not good at drawing, I just kept practicing and trying my best.bI draw for fun and to describe things in more fun way. My favorite type of drawing or art is sketching and coloring. I recommend you trying it too. Drawing means a picture or diagram made with a pencil, pen rather than paint. Painting means the process or art of using paint, in a picture, as a protective coating, or as decoration.<br>I also enjoy sci-fi books. My favorites of all time is Harry Potter by JK.Rowling. I started a book called Keeper of the Lost Cities. It is amazing. To be honest I think I like the keeper of the Lost Cities(some people call it KOTLC for short) more than Harry potter.I recommend you to read it too.Hope you enjoy!!</p>
